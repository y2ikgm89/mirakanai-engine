# GameEngine editor (Cursor)

| Layer | Path |
| --- | --- |
| Claude Code | `.claude/skills/gameengine-editor/SKILL.md` |
| Detailed reference | `.claude/skills/gameengine-editor/references/full-guidance.md` |
| Codex | `.agents/skills/editor-change/SKILL.md` |
| Baseline | `AGENTS.md` |

Read the Claude router first. Load the detailed reference from the table when retained ids, editor-shell boundaries, validation lanes, or contract needles are required.

The visible `MK_editor` shell is active through the dependency-free `desktop-editor` lane; keep `MK_editor_core` GUI-independent and in the default validation lane. See `.cursor/rules/mirakana-editor-first-party-shell.mdc`.

Prefer first-party editor documents, stable `mirakana::ui` ids, semantic roles, and private shell adapters; do not adapt editor work to Dear ImGui or UI middleware.

Validation: focused `MK_editor_core_tests` / `check-tidy.ps1 -Files` loops while iterating, then `tools/validate.ps1` at the slice gate per `AGENTS.md`.
