# Production Completion Master Plan v1 (2026-05-03)

Plan ID: `production-completion-master-plan-v1`
Status: Active lightweight index.
Detailed corpus: [production-completion-v1/01-one-dot-zero-readiness-ledger.md](production-completion-v1/01-one-dot-zero-readiness-ledger.md), [04-developer-owned-engine-capability-backlog.md](production-completion-v1/04-developer-owned-engine-capability-backlog.md), [05-projections-and-scenarios.md](production-completion-v1/05-projections-and-scenarios.md), and [99-historical-verdict-archive.md](production-completion-v1/99-historical-verdict-archive.md).
Active execution pointer: `engine/agent/manifest.json.aiOperableProductionLoop.currentActivePlan`.

## Purpose

This file is the master plan index. It intentionally stays small so Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, and other agents can find the right production-completion chapter without spending context on the full historical plan.

Use the chapter that matches the current decision. Do not bulk-read every chapter unless the task requires a full production readiness audit.

## Current Verdict

- 1.0 closeout readiness remains manifest-led: every `unsupportedProductionGaps` row in `engine/agent/manifest.json.aiOperableProductionLoop` must be implemented, host-gated with evidence, or explicitly excluded with evidence before a ready claim; the current composed manifest has no remaining rows.
- Current execution remains manifest-led. Do not hand-edit `engine/agent/manifest.json`; edit `engine/agent/manifest.fragments/*.json` and run the compose script when manifest state changes.
- Current active plan: [Memory Lifetime Taxonomy v1](../plans/2026-06-01-memory-lifetime-taxonomy-v1.md) is the active optimization-foundation child after [Performance Baseline v1](../plans/2026-06-01-performance-baseline-v1.md) completed the selected measurement/evidence lane.
- Current manifest state: `unsupportedProductionGaps = []`; `recommendedNextPlan.id = memory-lifetime-taxonomy-v1`. The active child defines ownership semantics, pointer/view lifetime rules, allocator boundaries, thread/job handoff rules, backend handle opacity, and AI-readable unsupported claims before allocator, all-core CPU, NUMA, GPU residency, CUDA/HIP/SYCL, or vendor-specific optimization implementation. Performance Baseline v1 added selected package frame budgets, p95/p99 diagnostics counters, `installed-2d-performance-baseline-smoke`, Trace Event JSON artifact references, docs, manifest rows, and static checks. AI-Operable Performance Budget And Evidence v1 completed through PR #361 / merge commit `e344326a270d39526be7e56d989bf96d86c01808` and added `game.agent.json.performanceBudgets`, manifest `performanceBudgetEvidenceLoops`, selected sample/template budget rows, and static checks. [First-Party Editor Shell v1](../plans/2026-05-31-first-party-editor-shell-v1.md) completed the clean-break first-party retained `MK_editor` replacement after [Native Win32 Editor Shell v1](../plans/2026-05-30-native-win32-editor-shell-v1.md) closed through PR #322, and [First-Party UI Editor Production Stack v1](../plans/2026-05-31-first-party-ui-editor-production-stack-v1.md) then completed first-party docking, rich text, Windows DirectWrite/TSF/UIA adapter evidence, D3D12 viewport/material texture display, AI-operable editor UX rows, and cross-platform adapter future gates without compatibility shims. Broad editable rich text, Direct2D GPU text rendering/upload, broad shaping/bidi/fallback, full app-owned `ITextStoreACP` callback coverage, native IME candidate UI, reconversion, full UIA control pattern/event parity, cross-platform editor/accessibility parity, Vulkan/Metal editor texture-display parity, broader material-preview GPU parity, SDL3, public native handles, filesystem/package mutation, runtime source parsing, runtime game UI middleware, broad renderer quality, and broad performance readiness remain unclaimed until focused phases validate them.
- Current gap cluster: no Engine 1.0 unsupported gap is open; the SDL3 removal milestone has closed with first-party Windows desktop runtime/editor/audio replacements, SDL3 removal from build, package, generated-game, docs, legal, and agent contract surfaces, and no macOS/Linux desktop parity claim from Windows evidence. The reviewed importer/codecs/shader-generation child also closed selected KTX2/Basis, glTF scene import, source image/audio codec, and shader generation/cache review rows while keeping broad import/codec/shader/runtime compiler/renderer residency/Metal claims fail-closed. Physics Navigation Commercial Coverage v1 closed optional adapter boundary, host validation recipe, and lifecycle evidence gates for physics/navigation breadth rows while keeping native handles, runtime bake/source mutation, and broad middleware parity fail-closed. Renderer Backend Parity Metal Apple Evidence v1 and Closeout v1 completed local/hosted Apple/Metal guardrails and returned the manifest to zero unsupported gaps. Renderer Postprocess Tone Mapping Evidence v1 completed a fail-closed D3D12/Vulkan/Metal tone-mapping proof contract without claiming broad postprocess execution or SDL3/native-handle readiness. Generic 2D Sandbox Production Lane v1 completed Phases 1-10 through PR #313 while keeping broad ready claims out of the manifest. First-Party Editor Shell v1 completed the dependency-free `desktop-editor` lane, first-party `mirakana::ui` / `MK_ui_renderer` shell contract, AI-operable editor rows, active Dear ImGui dependency removal, and inactive implementation deletion without compatibility aliases.

## Official implementation rule

Prefer official documentation and SDK guidance first: CMake, vcpkg, Direct3D 12, Vulkan, Metal, Android GameActivity, platform SDKs, OpenAI Codex docs, Anthropic Claude Code docs, and vendor engine references where explicitly cited in the chapter.

This is a greenfield engine. Use clean breaking changes when they remove duplicated contracts, stale compatibility layers, or ambiguous API ownership.

## AI readability contract

- This plan describes a general-purpose game engine, not a genre-specific engine.
- Read the parent index first, then load only the chapter that owns the current decision.
- Treat gameplay archetypes as validation scenarios, not product templates or mandatory engine feature bundles.
- Prefer reusable engine primitives: input, simulation, scene, assets, rendering, audio, UI, persistence, networking, tooling, validation, and packaging.
- Keep game-specific rules, balance, content, and presentation in game-owned files unless the same capability is reusable across multiple gameplay families.
- Missing reusable engine capability becomes a developer-owned backlog row; game-creation agents must not patch engine internals.

## Generic engine decision rule

Promote a feature into the engine only when it is reusable across at least two gameplay families, has a stable public contract, can be validated without one specific game, and can be exposed safely to AI through manifests or reviewed tools. Otherwise keep it in sample/game code.
## AI game-creation boundary

Game-creation agents may generate and edit game-owned files, code, and assets under `games/<game_name>/`. They must not mutate engine internals, editor internals, shared tools, schemas, agent policy, CMake/vcpkg contracts, or validation policy while acting as game creators.

When a generated game needs an engine capability that is missing, record a developer-owned handoff in the capability backlog instead of patching engine internals from the game-creation flow.

## Maintenance contract

- Keep this index small.
- Put durable details in the chapter that owns them.
- Keep static checks pointed at this index plus the four-file production-completion corpus.
- Update `AGENTS.md`, skills, rules, subagents, manifest fragments, schemas, and validation checks when durable workflow or AI-operable contracts change.
