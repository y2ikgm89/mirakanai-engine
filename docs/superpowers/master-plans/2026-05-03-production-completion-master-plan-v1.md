# Production Completion Master Plan v1 (2026-05-03)

Plan ID: `production-completion-master-plan-v1`
Status: Active lightweight index.
Detailed corpus: [production-completion-v1/01-one-dot-zero-readiness-ledger.md](production-completion-v1/01-one-dot-zero-readiness-ledger.md), [04-developer-owned-engine-capability-backlog.md](production-completion-v1/04-developer-owned-engine-capability-backlog.md), [05-projections-and-scenarios.md](production-completion-v1/05-projections-and-scenarios.md), and [99-historical-verdict-archive.md](production-completion-v1/99-historical-verdict-archive.md).
Active execution pointer: `engine/agent/manifest.json.aiOperableProductionLoop.currentActivePlan`.

## Purpose

This file is the master plan index. It intentionally stays small so Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, and other agents can find the right production-completion chapter without spending context on the full historical plan.

Use the chapter that matches the current decision. Do not bulk-read every chapter unless the task requires a full production readiness audit.

## Current Verdict

- 1.0 closeout readiness remains manifest-led: every `unsupportedProductionGaps` row in `engine/agent/manifest.json.aiOperableProductionLoop` must be implemented, host-gated with evidence, or explicitly excluded with evidence before a ready claim; the current composed manifest has no remaining rows.
- Current execution remains manifest-led. Do not hand-edit `engine/agent/manifest.json`; edit `engine/agent/manifest.fragments/*.json` and run the compose script when manifest state changes.
- Current active plan: no child plan is selected. `engine/agent/manifest.json.aiOperableProductionLoop.currentActivePlan` points back to this production-completion master plan after [First-Party Desktop Platform And SDL3 Removal v1](../plans/2026-05-27-first-party-desktop-platform-sdl3-removal-v1.md) closed the Windows-first native desktop backend and SDL3 deletion milestone. [Reviewed Importers Codecs And Shader Generation v1](../plans/2026-05-27-reviewed-importers-codecs-shader-generation-v1.md) is paused and must be resumed only through an explicit manifest/registry switch.
- Current manifest state: `unsupportedProductionGaps = []`; `recommendedNextPlan.id = next-production-gap-selection` marks the next production-gap selection gate. Historical zero-gap closeout evidence remains discoverable through the retained plan registry and archive.
- Current gap cluster: no Engine 1.0 unsupported gap is open; the active post-foundation milestone replaces SDL3 desktop runtime/editor/audio surfaces with first-party Windows backends, then removes SDL3 from build, package, generated-game, docs, legal, and agent contract surfaces without claiming macOS/Linux desktop parity from Windows evidence.

## Official implementation rule

Prefer official documentation and SDK guidance first: CMake, vcpkg, SDL3, Direct3D 12, Vulkan, Metal, Android GameActivity, OpenAI Codex docs, Anthropic Claude Code docs, and vendor engine references where explicitly cited in the chapter.

This is a greenfield engine. Use clean breaking changes when they remove duplicated contracts, stale compatibility layers, or ambiguous API ownership.

## AI readability contract

- This plan describes a general-purpose game engine, not a genre-specific engine.
- Read the parent index first, then load only the chapter that owns the current decision.
- Treat gameplay archetypes as validation scenarios, not product templates or mandatory engine feature bundles.
- Prefer reusable engine primitives: input, simulation, scene, assets, rendering, audio, UI, persistence, networking, tooling, validation, and packaging.
- Keep game-specific rules, balance, content, and presentation in game-owned files unless the same capability is reusable across multiple gameplay families.
- Missing reusable engine capability becomes a developer-owned backlog row; game-creation agents must not patch engine internals.

## Generic engine decision rule

Promote a feature into the engine only when it is reusable across at least two gameplay families, has a stable public contract, can be validated without one specific game, and can be exposed safely to AI through manifests or reviewed tools. Otherwise keep it in sample/game code.
## AI game-creation boundary

Game-creation agents may generate and edit game-owned files, code, and assets under `games/<game_name>/`. They must not mutate engine internals, editor internals, shared tools, schemas, agent policy, CMake/vcpkg contracts, or validation policy while acting as game creators.

When a generated game needs an engine capability that is missing, record a developer-owned handoff in the capability backlog instead of patching engine internals from the game-creation flow.

## Maintenance contract

- Keep this index small.
- Put durable details in the chapter that owns them.
- Keep static checks pointed at this index plus the four-file production-completion corpus.
- Update `AGENTS.md`, skills, rules, subagents, manifest fragments, schemas, and validation checks when durable workflow or AI-operable contracts change.
